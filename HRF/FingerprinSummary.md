# Fingerprint Summary

For fingerprint we have two important task:
- Verification (1-1 Matching)
- Classification (1-N Matching)

In a Automatic Fingerprint Recognition System (AFRS), We ues query to matching template store in database.

## Fingerprint Representation & Feature Extraction 

> Q: How to represent fingerprint for verification or classification?

### Fingerprint Feature

There are three level features in fingerprint:
- Level One: Global ridge pattern
  - Loop
  - Sigular point
- Level Two: Minutiae Point
  - ridge bifucation
  - ridge ending
- Level Three: 
  - Pore
  - Ridge contours






## Fingerprint Mathcing & Recognition

Level Two feature

1. Localize the minutiae point and extract
2. Find minutiae point correspondences
3. Calculate similiarity
4. Use threshold to do decision 


Level Three feature


## Evaluation

- False Matching Rate (FMR)
- False Non-Matching Rate (FNMR)
- Equal Error Rate (EER)
- Rece of Curve (ROC)
- Detect Error Trade-off
- False Acceptance Rate (FAR)
- False Rejection Rate (FRR)
